# staticStorefront
This is my static storefront project for the ElevenFifty Academy coding foundations course.
The links aren't active, and it does not navigate to anywhere else. It could with some extra work on the link destinations.
I may work on it some more after the class is done to keep practicing and increaseing my knowledge.
